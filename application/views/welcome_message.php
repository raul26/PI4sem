        <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/domotica/img2.png");?>">
         <p> Domotics is a field which involves the creation of automated controls for homes, ranging from lights which click on when someone enters a room to smart washing machines which select the appropriate cycle and time for a load of clothing. People may refer to domotics as home automation or "smart home systems," depending on the region they live in and their approach to the field. Domotics can encompass both hardware and software, with customized systems built specifically for the purpose along with existing systems which are modified.</p>
